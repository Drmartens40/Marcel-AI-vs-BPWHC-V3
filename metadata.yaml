abstract: |
  We investigate the impact of initialization on a hybrid reinforcement learning agent named Marcel, developed with a specific architecture integrating modules F, B, and M. Two independent seeds (40090 and 202507) were used to train the agent across a 3,500-episode schedule, including a 1,000-episode curriculum-based pre-training phase. The results show marked asymmetry: seed 40090 leads to a positive late-stage performance plateau, while seed 202507 stagnates in a low-reward regime. We discuss this divergence in the context of seed sensitivity, convergence profiles, and reward distribution in hybrid actor-critic frameworks.
